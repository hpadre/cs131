Do you think the mean helpfulness value may differ significantly between different  customers or products? You may edit a file named README in vi or nano or emacs to answer this question, as well as any other explanations you like to add.

I think the helpfulness value differs significantly between different customers than products.
Here are the results:

As we can see, there is a larger variance between helpfulness scores in customer ID's. Also, the scores are higher than in product ID.This makes sense to me because I would expect a good reviewer to consistently make helpful reviews per product. Also, as more reviews are written, I would expect this customer to improve upon their writing and quality of reviews.

Looking at helpfulness value based on product ID is interesting, because this means, for example, the product 0439139597 has an average helpfulness rating of 1.52, so a lot of reviews of this product are not helpful. Perhaps, this is a difficult product to create a review for.
